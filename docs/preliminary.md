	- Data
		- Setup
			- Rate (br/min)
			- Tidal Volume (ml)
			- IPAP (Initial pressure in cm H2O)
			- EPAP (Expiratory pressure in cm H2O)
			- FiO2 (%)
			- PEEP (mm Hg)
			- IFR (Inspiratory Flow Rate in L/min - 60L/min normally, 80-100L/min COPD)
			- EFR (Expiratory Flow Rate in L/min - 60L/min normally, 80-100L/min COPD)
		- Measured (MAX and MIN validation)
			- Pressure (in)
			- Flow (in)
			- Pressure (out)
			- Flow (out)
			- O2
			- CO2 (additional)
			- Voltage (additional)
		- Calculated (MAX and MIN validation)
			- Peak pressure (max point)
			- Plateau pressure (point constant in specific time after starting exhalation)
			- Peep pressure (point constant in specific time after exhalation)
			- Lung compliance (difference in changing pressure towards volume change)
		- Timers (MAX and MIN validation)
			- Breath length in milis
			- Breath not made for x milis
			- Plateau pressure (triggered at exhaust, 0.5-1.5 sec, measurement point of constant pressure)
		- Automatic shutdowns - failsafes (different thread)
			- Volume limit
			- Pressure limit
		- ALARMS
			- Loose hose (flow at maximum but no pressure)
			- Obstruction (pressure but no flow)
			- Breath stacking
			- High Plateau pressure
			- Low Plateau pressure
			- Lung incompliance (high pressure, low volume)
			- Low battery warning
			- Incomplete breath (no exhalation)
			- Low CO2 level
			- High CO2 level
			- Inhalation to Exhalation ratio (normally 1:3)
			- Detectors:
				- COPD (high CO2 levels, long exhalation)
				- ARDS (high pressure, low volume - incompliant lung)
