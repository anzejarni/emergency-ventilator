# Ideas and questions
This document is intended for new ideas and questions that need to be resolved with a medical professional

# Ideas
- Can the circuit resistance be measured using both flow meters and calculating the complete circuit resistance? Ventilator I Output -> Tube -> (closed-loop no patient, no resistance) -> Tube -> Ventilator E Input
- Can the circuit resistance be measured using auxiliary sensor connected where the mouthpiece should be and measuring the I&E resistance? Ventilator I Output -> Tube -> Flow Sensor -> Tube -> Ventilator E Input


# Questions
- Should we add the option for a Co2 sensor?
- Can we automate some functionality by adding CO2 and pH sensor and maintain O2/CO2 homeostasis
- Should deadspace be considered in the calculations? If so, is it also in settings?
- Can someone check the limits document?
- Can someone check the hardware document and give advice?
- What is the percent in Circuit Compliance Compensation? Should it be a setting in percent?
- Should PID be used in controlling algorithms (especially to avoid pressure overshooting)?
