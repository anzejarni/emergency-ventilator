# Sigh function
If this function is enabled, the ventilator periodically provides larger-than-normal mechanical breath. Generally defined by two possible settings:
- One sigh per X breaths (50 or 100)
- Number of sighs per hour (4 or 6)

A sigh will have 1.5 times the current set Vt or 10 cmH2O greater than current pressure setting
