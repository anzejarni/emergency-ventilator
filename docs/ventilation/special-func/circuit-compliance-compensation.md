# Compliance Compensation
When the system is in the Volume Control mode, the tidal volume will not be correct. For example, if the patient has tidal volume set to 500 mL, the airway tidal volume is only about 450 mL.

This circuit volume loss is due to pressure fluctuations in the system. It could be compensate by providing higher Tidal Volume by some factor, so if the expected tidal volume is 500 mL, the ventilator
will deliver 550 mL into the circuit. This function is called Circuit Compliance Compensation Feature and should be displayed on the main screen.

- The correct percent of increase has to be investigated!
