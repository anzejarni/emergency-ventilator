# Automatic Tube Compensation for Airway Resistance
Tracheal intubation (ETT, TT) significantly decreases the effective cross section, posing higher resistance to air movement.
The intubated patients must breath harder because of this resistance and ATC compensates for a smaller cross area.
Do not confuse this with respiratory resistance.

Airway resistance may increase for several oter reasons, which are obstructed or kinked tracheal tube or HME clogged with secretions.
These are emergencies, requiring immediate correction.
