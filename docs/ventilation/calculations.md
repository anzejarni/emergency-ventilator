# Breath Cycle Time (Complete Breath Cycle)
BCT = Ti (Time of Inspiration) + Te (Time of Expiration)
BCT = 60 / Set Respiraty Rate (b/min)

# IBW (Ideal Body Weight - Broca equation)
Women: IBW [kg] = (height[cm] - 100) - ((height[cm] - 100) * 15%)
Men: IBW [kg] = (height[cm] - 100) - ((height[cm] - 100) * 10%)

# Lung Compliance
C' = delta V (change in volume) / delta P (change in pressure)

# Flow (Q)
Q (Flow) = V (Volume) / t (time)
