# Dead Space
Dead space is the portion of tidal volume that is not involved in gas exchange.
It consists of two parts:
- Anatomical dead space: the volume of gass to fill the respiratory tract except for gas exchange areas.
- Alevolar dead space: the volume of those alevoli that are venilated but not perfused. Alevolar dead space is negligible in healty patients, but can increade dramatically in some long diseases

Physiological dead space is the sum o anatomical and alevolar dead spaces. It is approximately 150 mL in a young adult, and it increases slightly with age.
Intubated patient has another type of dead space: insteumental dead space (volume that fills the artifical airway from Y pieye to the opening of the natural upper airway

Alevolar ventilation per minute decreases when total dead space increases, provided that rate and tidal volume remain unchanged:

Total dead space = Anatomical dead space + Alevolar dead space + Instrumental dead space
Alevolar ventilation per minute = Rate * (Tidal volume - Total dead space)

The amount if instrumental dead space may range from negligible to considerable depending on accessories (prox. flow sensor, flex tube, HME, CO2 sensor)

# Remarks
- Is this important only for the expert or also for the machine?
- Can it be calculated (at least for the circuit)?
